Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for decades. It is a simple game that involves guessing a secret word one letter at a time before a stick figure is completely drawn, representing a hanged man. Recently, I built a Hangman game using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. My version of the game features a clean and minimalistic design, with a responsive layout that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

The Hangman game I built using ReactJS offers a fun and engaging way to improve your vocabulary and spelling skills. Players can choose from a variety of categories, including animals, countries, and famous people, and then guess letters to reveal the hidden word. Each incorrect guess results in a part of the stick figure being drawn, and players have to guess the word before the figure is completely drawn to win the game. With its user-friendly interface and addictive gameplay, my Hangman game is a great way to pass the time and challenge your brain.
